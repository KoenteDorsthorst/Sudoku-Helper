# Sudoku-Helper
Helps solve sudoku's. Made very quickly.


## Usage

This program can help solve sudoku's by doing some simple steps for every square:

1. Remove possibilities for the current square by looking at numbers in the horizontal and vertical rows of the board. Also check the already used numbers in the board square.

2. Check if the square is the only one with a specific possibilty in the horizontal and vertical rows of the board. Also check if theres only one specific possibility in the square.

3. Repeat

This has solved the few sudoku's I tested with this.

## Origin story

I was trying to solve a sudoku and failed at the last step twice. I became a bit irritated, but didn't want to just use an online solver. I made this instead. It works I think.
